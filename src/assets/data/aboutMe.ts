    'I am an UI Developer, with around 6.5 years of experience in various UI technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Typescript, OOJS, Angular  (7-13), React etc.',
    'I prefer, myself to be recognized as a problem solver, rather than just a Developer. I try not to be restricted by technologies. I like following and am good at recognizing patterns, which helps me in getting into any new technology or framework pretty quickly. Over the time, in my current organization, there were times, when I was simultaneously working in multiple projects with different Tech stack. Context switching comes very naturally to me. When challenged, I give my all, to over come the challenge. I love to constantly refactor my code. When ever I learn a better way to do the thing, I have done in past, I push to refactor the code. I don\'t believe in the saying "Don\'t touch it if it\'s working".',
    'I speak my mind. I come up clearly on my thoughts on a matter, and give the reasoning behind my thinking (mostly during Sprint Meetings). I love to understand workflows (rather than just coding whats given to me) and try to make them better from an end user experience point of view.',
    'I have done my B.Sc. in IT & Management and my MBA in IT and Finance. During my initial days, I used to work as a Plant Manager for a PDW (Packaged Drinking Water) plant, for brand Aquasure (from Aquaguard - Eureka Forbes), managing around 40 people. But I always had a liking for IT, since my graduation days, which made me shift my career into development profile. Better late than never.'
