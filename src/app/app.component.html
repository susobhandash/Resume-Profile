  <div class="scroll-section ta-justify pr-md">
    <p class="text-md mb-sm mt-0">
      I am an UI Developer, with around 6.5 years of experience in various UI technologies like HTML, CSS,
      Javascript, jQuery, Typescript, Angular (7-13), React etc.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md mb-sm">
      I have been working not just as a UI developer, but mostly as a Problem solver, which I pride myself upon.
      There has been many projects that I have been included in, irrespective of
      the technologies used, and my managers always had the faith that I will be able to perform and contribute,
      some times in multiple projects simultaneously, as I am very good
      at switching contexts and identifying and creating patterns in any technology I use. This has helped me
      build a image of a dependable, responsible and dynamic developer. Apart
      from these skills, my expertise in CSS have helped me carve a niche among other UI developers in our
      organization.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md mb-sm">
      I have done my B.Sc. in IT & Management and my MBA in IT and Finance. During my initial days, I used to
      work as a Plant Manager for a PDW (Packaged Drinking Water) plant, for brand Aquasure (from Aquaguard -
      Eureka Forbes), managing around 40 people.
      But I always had a liking for IT since my graduation days which made me shift my career into development
      profile.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md mb-sm">
      I started my development career with basic Javascript, jQuery and CSS stuffs, building reusable libraries
      for professional work and trying my hands on building libraries and games with
      Vanilla Javascript for my own learning purpose. When I shifted to a new project, I got a chance to work
      starting in Angular 7. But I was mostly in charge of developing wireframe and
      very basic UI components like configurable Menu List, Filterable Tree List etc. We worked in Kendo Angular
      UI library, so most component came from there, but in between we kept
      having requirements for some components which did not exist in the Kendo library like Indeterminate
      Progress bar, Circular Progress bar etc. I took it upon myself and started
      developing those components and later made them as a Library and published it to npm. Apart from these
      stuffs, I used to created reusable components like Modal component with custom
      features like Close on Escape, perform some action on Enter click, created wrappers around Kendo library
      component for easier upgrading etc, all these while being the sole in-charge
      for the styling part of the whole application. We had our own style guide, based on which I had created
      multiple LESS files, some to handle reusable components styling, some to
      handle style for Kendo components style overrides, media queries etc.
    </p>
    <p class="text-md mb-sm">
      When I moved to my next project, the initial one month I worked as a helping resource to the project. I
      was in charge of fine tuning, enhancing and restructuring the existing
      codebase. I spent a lot of time, creating patterns, flows and rewriting a lot of components, sometimes
      merging them to make reusable components as much as I can. Over time I was
      the sole developer contributing to the application for about 3+ years. Over the time, I built many
      patterns and highly reusable components, which made the development much easier and faster.
      I, single handedly, contributed in implementing Access Control framework, Annotation framework, Custom
      View Saving, Elastic Search, Notification, Chat, Dashboards, Custom Theming, etc apart
      from regular development of around 8 modules and more than a hundred reusable components. Also took care
      of application performance through lazy loading, tree shaking, moving most reusable codes into
      base classes etc. We were using the PrimeNG library for most UI components, so I created wrapper
      components around them to provide additional capabilities like adding custom control
      or action to those components. Created multiple pipes and directive to take care of localization using
      Angular's inbuilt services. This is the project which helped me learn Angular extensively.
      Later more people came into the UI team, whom I had to train and mentor since last one year so that I
      could move to new projects.
