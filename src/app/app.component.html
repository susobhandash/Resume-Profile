              I am an UI Developer, with around 6.5 years of experience in various UI technologies like HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, jQuery, Typescript, Angular (7-13), React etc.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-sm">
              I have been working not just as a UI developer, but mostly as a Problem solver, which I pride myself upon.
              There has been many projects that I have been included in, irrespective of
              the technologies used, and my managers always had the faith that I will be able to perform and contribute,
              some times in multiple projects simultaneously, as I am very good
              at switching contexts and identifying and creating patterns in any technology I use. This has helped me
              build a image of a dependable, responsible and dynamic developer. Apart
              from these skills, my expertise in CSS have helped me carve a niche among other UI developers in our
              organization.

            <p class="text-md mb-sm">
              I have done my B.Sc. in IT & Management and my MBA in IT and Finance. During my initial days, I used to
              work as a Plant Manager for a PDW (Packaged Drinking Water) plant, for brand Aquasure (from Aquaguard -
              Eureka Forbes), managing around 40 people.
              But I always had a liking for IT since my graduation days which made me shift my career into development
              profile.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-sm">
              I started my development career with basic Javascript, jQuery and CSS stuffs, building reusable libraries
              for professional work and trying my hands on building libraries and games with
              Vanilla Javascript for my own learning purpose. When I shifted to a new project, I got a chance to work
              starting in Angular 7. But I was mostly in charge of developing wireframe and
              very basic UI components like configurable Menu List, Filterable Tree List etc. We worked in Kendo Angular
              UI library, so most component came from there, but in between we kept
              having requirements for some components which did not exist in the Kendo library like Indeterminate
              Progress bar, Circular Progress bar etc. I took it upon myself and started
              developing those components and later made them as a Library and published it to npm. Apart from these
              stuffs, I used to created reusable components like Modal component with custom
              features like Close on Escape, perform some action on Enter click, created wrappers around Kendo library
              component for easier upgrading etc, all these while being the sole in-charge
              for the styling part of the whole application. We had our own style guide, based on which I had created
              multiple LESS files, some to handle reusable components styling, some to
              handle style for Kendo components style overrides, media queries etc.

              When I moved to my next project, the initial one month I worked as a helping resource to the project. I
              was in charge of fine tuning, enhancing and restructuring the existing
              codebase. I spent a lot of time, creating patterns, flows and rewriting a lot of components, sometimes
              merging them to make reusable components as much as I can. Over time I was
              the sole developer contributing to the application for about 3+ years. Over the time, I built many
              patterns and highly reusable components, which made the development much easier and faster.
              I, single handedly, contributed in implementing Access Control framework, Annotation framework, Custom
              View Saving, Elastic Search, Notification, Chat, Dashboards, Custom Theming, etc apart
              from regular development of around 8 modules and more than a hundred reusable components. Also took care
              of application performance through lazy loading, tree shaking, moving most reusable codes into
              base classes etc. We were using the PrimeNG library for most UI components, so I created wrapper
              components around them to provide additional capabilities like adding custom control
              or action to those components. Created multiple pipes and directive to take care of localization using
              Angular's inbuilt services. This is the project which helped me learn Angular extensively.
              Later more people came into the UI team, whom I had to train and mentor since last one year so that I
              could move to new projects.
